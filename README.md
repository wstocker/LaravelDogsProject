# LaravelDogsProject
Coding exercise using the Laravel framework

Coding Example

Below is the test that one of the dev's has documented. We basically want to see that you know MVC, can read documentation, use a database. It shouldnâ€™t take too long, if you have any questions please let me know.

The test is to make a quick laravel app where you see a list of dogs and can add new dogs. This should consist of making a quick migration, a model, a single resource controller filling out the index, create and store methods, and the corresponding view. You don't have to get crazy with the fields, just a name is fine. Please configure your at least your login controller to return JSON and use VueJS.

For styling just use bootstrap, zurb or your CSS framework of choice, you don't need to get too complicated. 

The goal is to see that you can work within an MVC framework and produce code that sets up a DB, adds to the DB, and has a usable front end for user interaction using AJAX.
